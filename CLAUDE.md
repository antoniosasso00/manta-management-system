# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

MES Aerospazio is a Manufacturing Execution System for aerospace component production, specializing in carbon fiber composite manufacturing. The system tracks work orders (ODL) through production departments including Clean Room (lamination) and Autoclaves (curing cycles) using QR code scanning and automated batch optimization.

Built as a Next.js 15.3.4 application following Domain-Driven Design principles with Atomic Design System UI components. Uses hybrid architecture: monolithic core with specialized Python microservices for computationally intensive algorithms.

## Business Domain Context

### Core Functionality
- **ODL (Work Orders)**: Track aerospace parts through production departments
- **QR Code System**: Generate unique codes for ODL tracking, scan for department entry/exit
- **Clean Room**: Lamination department with time tracking and resource allocation
- **Autoclavi**: Curing department with batch optimization algorithm (2D nesting problem)
- **Gamma Integration**: Sync data from existing MES Gamma TeamSystem via file exports

### Production Flow
```
ODL Creation â†’ Clean Room (Lamination) â†’ Autoclavi (Curing) â†’ NDI â†’ Rifilatura â†’ etc.
    â†“             â†“ QR Scan In/Out      â†“ Batch Optimization (Python Service)
Gamma Sync    Time Tracking         2D Layout Planning + Auto Assignment
```

### Key Business Rules
- ODL have Part Numbers (format: alphanumeric like 8G5350A0...)
- Autoclavi constraints: compatible curing cycles, vacuum lines, size limits
- Production shifts: 6-14, 14-22
- Mobile-first UI for operators (smartphone QR scanning)

## Critical Implementation Architecture

### Authentication Flow
- **NextAuth v5** with custom Credentials provider (`src/lib/auth.ts`)
- **Role-based access**: `UserRole` enum (ADMIN, SUPERVISOR, OPERATOR) in Prisma schema
- **Route protection**: All routes protected by default via `middleware.ts`, except auth pages
- **Session management**: JWT tokens with user ID and role embedded
- **Password security**: bcryptjs hashing in registration API route

### Database Architecture
- **Prisma schema** (`prisma/schema.prisma`): Core entities are User, ODL, Department, Autoclave, ProductionEvent
- **ODL tracking**: Central entity with QR codes, part numbers, status workflow, dimensions for autoclave optimization
- **Production events**: Audit trail of ODL movements through departments (entry/exit tracking)
- **Autoclave optimization**: AutoclaveLoad entity stores batch layouts as JSON with 2D positioning data
- **Gamma sync**: GammaSyncLog tracks file-based integration status

### Validation Architecture
- **Zod schemas** in `src/domains/*/schemas/`: Shared between client/server for type safety
- **Form validation**: React Hook Form + Zod resolver pattern in auth pages
- **API validation**: Server-side schema validation in API routes before database operations
- **Runtime safety**: TypeScript inference from Zod schemas ensures compile-time + runtime type checking

### Component Architecture Strategy
- **Atomic Design implemented**: `src/components/atoms/` wrap MUI components with custom props
- **MUI integration**: Custom theme in `src/lib/theme.ts` with mobile-first 44px touch targets
- **Provider pattern**: Root layout includes MUI ThemeProvider + React Query client
- **Mobile optimization**: All components designed for smartphone use in industrial environment

### QR Code System Architecture
- **Generation**: `qrcode` library creates codes with ODL/Department data as JSON
- **Scanning**: `@zxing/browser` (React 19 compatible) for camera-based scanning
- **Data format**: JSON with `{type, id, timestamp}` structure parsed by `src/utils/helpers.ts`
- **Validation**: QR data validation through Zod schemas before processing

## MVP Development Plan

- Multi-constraint optimization (cycles, dimensions, priorities)

### Week 7-8: Integration & Deploy
- Gamma MES file synchronization
- Basic reporting system
- Production deployment

## Important Implementation Notes

### Python Microservices Strategy
Complex computational algorithms are implemented as separate Python microservices for:

**1. Autoclave Nesting Optimization Service**
- 2D bin packing algorithm for optimal space utilization
- Multi-constraint satisfaction (cycles, dimensions, vacuum lines, priorities)
- Performance target: <30 seconds optimization time
- Libraries: NumPy, SciPy, OR-Tools for advanced optimization
- Fallback to manual positioning if optimization fails

**2. ODL Assignment Engine Service**  
- Automatic workforce allocation based on skills matrix and availability
- Real-time workload balancing across operators
- Machine learning-based performance prediction
- Shift optimization and scheduling algorithms

**3. Performance Analytics Service**
- Real-time KPI calculation and trend analysis
- Production efficiency metrics and bottleneck detection
- Predictive maintenance algorithms for equipment

### Microservice Communication
- **API Gateway**: Next.js API routes proxy requests to Python services
- **Data Format**: JSON payloads with Zod validation on both ends
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with manual override options
- **Monitoring**: Health checks and performance metrics via Docker Compose

### Mobile-First Design
Operators use personal smartphones for QR scanning:
- Large touch targets (44px minimum)
- High contrast for industrial lighting
- Offline-capable PWA for network interruptions
- Simple, single-purpose interfaces

### Integration Considerations
- Gamma MES: Read-only file-based sync (CSV/Excel exports)
- No direct database access to existing systems
- Python Services: Docker containers with REST APIs
- Staging: Netlify frontend + local backend via ngrok + containerized services
- Production: On-premise server deployment with full Docker Compose stack

### Service Architecture Benefits
- **Scalability**: Python services can scale independently based on computational load
- **Technology Optimization**: Use best language for each problem (TypeScript for UI, Python for algorithms)
- **Development Speed**: Teams can work on services independently
- **Fault Tolerance**: Service failures don't crash entire application
- **Performance**: CPU-intensive algorithms optimized with scientific Python libraries
